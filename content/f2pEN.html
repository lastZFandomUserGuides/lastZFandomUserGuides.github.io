<H1>F2P</H1>

MUST do for a F2P if you want to keep up! It might sound harsh, but it's the truth.<br><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
1. Full preparedness, open 3 chests three times to unlock all daily main chests! See the <a style="color: red" href="./events_full_preparedness.html">Full Preparedness page</a>.<br><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
2. Duel Event. Make sure to follow the Full Preparedness guide so when Duel comes you have the resources required
to unlock those Duel boxes! In combination with maximizing your Alliance Recognition research (MUST DO) you will gain
items quickly! See <a style="color: red" href="./events_alliance_duel.html">Duel page</a>.<br><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
3. Attend during State versus State event and unlock all boxes by scoring 2 250 000 points. Doing so gives you Valor
points which you spend on buying Orange gear pieces for your troops and cores that are required for upgrading orange
gear.<br><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
