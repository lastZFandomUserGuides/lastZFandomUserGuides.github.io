<h1>Full Preparedness</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Full Preparedness (FP) is a MUST for F2P players. It gives vital items to grow your account.<br>
You need to open all 3 boxes 3 times in the various events to collect all daily rewards.<br>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Focus on the following events and read below how to maximize each event below without wasting any speedups or important items.<br>

<li> <a>Hero Initiative</a></li>
<li> <a>Mod Vehicle Boost</a></li>
<li> <a>Army Expansion</a></li>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<h3>Hero Initiative</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <strong>To open 3 chests:</strong><br>
    You don't need any material used during Duel.
    Save hero experience for this event, and make sure you have enough
    to score 3 boxes in the next one.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br>
    DO NOT USE RECRUITMENT TICKETS TO OPEN 3 CHESTS!<br>
    Maximum 1 to unlock daily snowball if it requires a recruitment ticket.
</p>

<h3>Mod Vehicle Boost</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <strong>To open 3 chests:</strong><br>
    Do boomers only until all 3 chests are opened.
    Don't do less than 15 to get the daily materials needed for S3 buildings.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br>
    DO NOT USE BLUEPRINTS OR WRENCHES TO OPEN FULL PREPAREDNESS CHESTS!
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <strong>BONUS:</strong><br>
    Boomers drop blueprints needed for the VS Duel event.<br>
    Season 2 and 3:
    They also drop experience for seasonal mastery, which is important.<br>
    Always do 15 boomers daily to get materials for upgrading seasonal buildings.
</p>

<h3>Army Expansion</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <strong>To open 3 chests:</strong><br>
    Finish one of each type to reach full rewards.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br>
    Try not to use speedups.<br>
    Plan ahead so that one batch of each soldier is ready before
    (or during) the FP event, then simply collect the reward without using speedups.
    Use speedups ONLY during Fridays when the soldier Duel event is active.
</p>

<h3>Shelter Upgrade & Research Upgrade</h3>
